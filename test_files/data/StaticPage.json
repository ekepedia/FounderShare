Completion of the process usually involves creating an account with a user name or identifier and password, which you agree to guard as confidential information and take all reasonable measures to keep secure. Additional information may be requested if you are a merchant that will be offering gift cards.&nbsp; In all instances in which you provide information to us, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information at all times, and to update it in a timely manner.

All Gift Card transactions on or through FounderShare are governed by these Terms of Use. &nbsp;All Gift Card transactions are made between the purchaser of a Gift Card and a merchant that offers that Gift Card for sale.&nbsp; FounderShare is not responsible or liable in any way for products or services purchased using a Gift Card.&nbsp; FounderShare makes no representations or warranties, and expressly disclaims any and all warranties or liability relating in any way to merchants that sell Gift Cards, the business practices of merchants that sell Gift Cards, any products or services offered by a merchant, the availability or suitability of any products or services offered by a merchant, or the availability of a merchant to conduct business or to honor a Gift Card.&nbsp; You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your purchase or use of the Gift Cards.</p>\n\n<p>The maximum amount that can be spent from your Gift Card account is the balance of your account. You may use your Gift Card account to purchase or lease goods or services as long as you do not exceed the value available in your account. Your Gift Card account may be used only at the businesses for which you have purchased gift cards.&nbsp; Some merchants do not allow split transactions where you would use the Gift Card as partial payment for goods and services and remit the remainder of the balance with another form of payment. If you wish to conduct a split transaction and it is permitted by the merchant, you must tell the merchant to charge only the exact amount of funds available in the account, and must then arrange to pay the difference using another payment method.</p>\n\n<p>Each time you use your Gift Card account, you authorize FounderShare to reduce the value available in your account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You are not allowed to exceed the available amount in your account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available in your account, you shall remain fully liable to for the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees.</p>\n\n<p>For security reasons, we may limit the amount or number of transactions you can make. Your account cannot be redeemed for cash. You may not use your Gift Card account for gambling or any illegal transaction.</p>\n\n<p>If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your account, you agree to accept credits to your Gift Card account for such refunds and agree to the refund policy of that merchant. If you have a problem with a purchase that you made with your Gift Card account, or if you have a dispute with the merchant, you must handle it directly with the merchant.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Buying Gift Cards</p>\n\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that you must pay for Gift Cards with a valid credit card (that you are authorized to use) or by other methods only as FounderShare may allow.&nbsp; You are responsible for all authorized transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of your GiftCards. If you permit another person to have access to your Gift Card account, we will treat this as if you have authorized such use and you will be liable for all transactions and fees incurred by those persons. You are wholly responsible for the use of each account according to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.</p>\n\n<p>If you lose your account credentials, please contact us at support@foundershare.com to request a replacement account.

You agree to retain, verify, and reconcile your transactions and receipts.</p>\n\n<p>FounderShare reserves the right to limit or discontinue your use of the Gift Cards or the Gift Card program in our sole discretion, including without limitation if we believe that you have engaged in fraud or other unlawful activities.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Selling Gift Cards</p>\n\n<p>If you are a merchant that sells Gift Cards through the FounderShare platform, you hereby represent and warrant and continue to represent and warrant, in connection with any Gift Card you sell through or on the Service, the following: (i) the Gift Card is valid; (ii) the Gift Card is redeemable for the amount of credit that you state on FounderShare; (iii) you will redeem the Gift Card when presented; (iv) the Gift Card and any interest therein is fully transferable to the purchaser in the manner contemplated by these Terms of Use; (v) you are the sole lawful owner of the Gift Card and all interests thereto; (vi) the Gift Card is not subject to any liens, obligations, or encumbrances of a third party; and (vii) you shall comply with all other requirements to complete the Gift Card transaction. FounderShare is not responsible for any errors that you have made in entering Gift Card information and is not liable for any such errors.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Requirements for Merchants to Receive Payments</p>\n\n<p>Merchants that use FounderShare to offer Gift Cards may use FounderShare&rsquo;s payment processing vendors to process credit cards.&nbsp; There are fees and additional requirements associated with the use of FounderShare&rsquo;s payment processing.&nbsp; To use payment processing, businesses must register as a submerchant on FounderShare&rsquo;s payment processing account, which will require providing information about your business and its owners to the payment process.</p>\n\n<p>FounderShare&rsquo;s payment processor is Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.&nbsp; Braintree provides businesses with the ability to accept credit and debit card payments for Gift Card purchases.

Box 794, Glastonbury, CT 06033 if you think your transaction history or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transaction listed on the transaction history or receipt. You must contact us no later than sixty (60) days after we have posted the transaction on which the problem or error occurred.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Provide your name and account username (if any).</li>\n\t<li>Describe the error or the transaction you are unsure about, and explain why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.</li>\n\t<li>Provide the dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you provide this information orally, we may require that you send your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) business days.

If you do not notify us in writing within sixty (60) days after you become aware of the transaction and/or after the statement was made available to you, you may not get back any value you lost after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the value if you had notified us in time or you are grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your account. If your account information has been lost or stolen, we will close your account to keep losses down.</p>\n\n<p>We reserve the right to require a written statement from you and to conduct an investigation into the validity of any request. You agree to cooperate with any investigation we may make.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Disputes</p>\n\n<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any FounderShare service, or to any products or services sold or distributed using FounderShare will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms of Use.</p>\n\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>\n\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to FounderShare, Inc. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA&rsquo;s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, FounderShare will not seek attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n\n<p>You and FounderShare each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. You and FounderShare also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n\n<p>Governing Law</p>\n\n<p>These Terms of Use will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, as applicable to contracts made and performed there without regard to its conflicts of law principles. You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Hartford County, Connecticut, USA and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</p>\n\n<p>Entire Agreement</p>",

There is no need to buy a point of sale system or physical gift cards, Founder$hare mobile gift cards are bought online and redeemed through smartphones.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a closed loop gift card?</h3>\n\n<p>A closed loop gift card is a term defined for a gift card that can only be used in a single store or group of stores.</p>\n\n<h3>Who is a Champion?</h3>\n\n<p>A Champion can be anyone who buys a Founder$hare mobile gift card, but at their most basic level, a Champion is someone who is passionate about supporting the businesses they frequent and wants to help them succeed. Your favorite coffee shop, hair salon, health food store; anyone you love visiting and want to support.</p>\n\n<h3>Who is a Business Owner?</h3>\n\n<p>A business owner is anyone who owns a business and is able to make decisions for that business.</p>\n\n<h3>Can I be both a Business Owner and a Champion?</h3>\n\n<p>Absolutely! If you have a favorite store that you like, you can buy gift cards for them too.</p>\n\n<h3>Can Founder$hare mobile gift cards be redeemed for online purchases?</h3>\n\n<p>Not at this time.</p>\n\n<h3>What does it cost?</h3>\n\n<p>The fees are discussed in detail in the &ldquo;Pricing&rdquo; section of FAQ. The only cost for champion is the cost of the gift card itself i.e. the cost of buying the gift cards to support the business owner. The Champion chooses the amount they want to spend. (No additional fees). Business owners pay a subscription fee (currently $99 per month) plus normal credit/debit card processing fees comparable to what they pay today for these types of transactions.</p>\n\n<h3>How do you protect my financial information?</h3>\n\n<p>We do not store your financial information in our system and we use a Level 1 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant service provider for all of our payment processing.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I provide feedback?</h3>\n\n<p>Either use the feedback form that you can see at the top of the webpage or email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hi.there@foundershare.com\">hi.there@foundershare.com</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>I see something offensive &ndash; what do I do?</h3>\n\n<p>Throughout the website (and on your phone), you will see a &ldquo;Report Abuse&rdquo; link or button. You can use these anytime you see something offensive or have a major problem.</p>\n\n<h3>What if I am really excited about FounderShare &ndash; what can I do to support this fabulous idea and the community that is being created?</h3>\n\n<p>Hooray!

Business Owners</h2>\n\n<h3>Are Founder$hare mobile gift cards for every business?</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no. You need to have a business where you or your employees see your customers at the time of the sale (money is transacted in person). Also, there are certain types of businesses that are not able to offer Founder$hare mobile gift cards. You can find the complete list in our Terms and Conditions. We are going to need you to look at the Terms and Conditions to find the list because the terms are important and we want you to read them.</p>\n\n<h3>Who decides on the terms of the Founder$hare mobile gift card offering?</h3>\n\n<p>As the business owner, you do! See below for more details.</p>\n\n<h3>Is there a maximum or minimum that can be offered?</h3>\n\n<p>There is no minimum. During our beta period, the maximum is $9,999.</p>\n\n<h3>What do I need to do to post an offer?</h3>\n\n<p>To post an offer, you need to:<br />\n1. Verify your business and set up your account payment details<br />\n2. Set your terms<br />\n3. Click the &ldquo;Post&rdquo; button and spread the word</p>\n\n<h3>How do I verify my business?</h3>\n\n<p>You can verify your business in a few short steps:<br />\n1. Subscribe<br />\n2. Fill out your account details<br />\n3. Let us know you&rsquo;re ready by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hi.there@foundershare.com\">hi.there@foundershare.com</a></p>\n\n<h3>What things should I think about when setting my terms?</h3>\n\n<p>Here are a few things to consider.<br />\n1. How much do you want to sell? We would suggest starting small and offering larger amounts over time. Your starter amount should be meaningful to you. For example, a total offer for $10 is not meaningful.<br />\n2. You need to decide on what discount (if any) you would like to offer. Our rule of thumb &ndash; enough to generate interest; not so much that it is not a good deal for you financially.<br />\n3. When you describe your business, this is your chance to strike up a conversation with your champions. What are you working toward/where are you taking your business?</p>\n\n<h3>I am not ready to post yet, do I have to pay subscription fees?</h3>\n\n<p>Nope. You can still open your Business Owner account and choose to subscribe later.</p>\n\n<h3>I am trying to post my Founder$hare gift card offer. Why doesn&rsquo;t my &ldquo;Post Now&rdquo; button work?</h3>\n\n<p>Check to make sure that your business has been verified and all of your terms have been filled in. Still having trouble? Send us an email at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:hi.there@foundershare.com\">hi.there@foundershare.com</a>&nbsp;or use the feedback form and we are happy to help you out.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens if I don&rsquo;t reach my goal?</h3>\n\n<p>You still get the funds from the gift cards that sold. For your next posting you can think about changing some of your terms for better success.</p>\n\n<h3>When do I receive my funds?</h3>\n\n<p>About 48 hours after a champion makes a purchase.</p>\n\n<h3>Can one business have multiple locations?</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for now, each business only has one point on the map.</p>\n\n<h3>My employees do not have smartphones. Are Founder$hare mobile gift cards for me?</h3>\n\n<p>Possibly. You will need to have a smartphone on hand for your employees to complete the sale and include this step in your planning. They do not have to use their own smartphone &ndash; you may choose to provide one for all of your employees to share.</p>\n\n<h3>What do I have to do at the point of sale when a customer wants to use a Founder$hare mobile gift card to pay?</h3>\n\n<p>Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foundershare.com/www.foundershare.com\">foundershare.com</a>&nbsp;on your smartphone. Enter your username and password. (We suggest doing this step at the beginning of the shift.) Follow the simple directions on the screen which are &ndash; type in the amount to be redeemed, scan the QR code from the champion&rsquo;s phone and click confirm.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens if I do not pay the monthly subscription fee?</h3>\n\n<p>If that&rsquo;s the case then you will not be able to post an offer, your current posting will be removed and you will lose access to the reports. You WILL be able to redeem the Founder$hare mobile gift cards for your champions.</p>\n\n<h3>Can I take my posting down?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes. It is the big red cancel button on your &ldquo;My Founder$hares&rdquo; page in your profile. Of course you are still obligated to redeem any Founder$hare mobile gift cards that were sold while the posting was open.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://foundershare.com/wp/?page_id=1174/#top\">BACK TO TOP</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>3. Champions</h2>\n\n<h3>How do I become a Champion?</h3>\n\n<p>You are already a Champion! Review the small businesses offering Founder$hare mobile gift cards and decide how much you want to buy and from whom. Follow the directions on the site.</p>\n\n<h3>Are there any limitations of how much a Champion can purchase?</h3>\n\n<p>We prefer that you keep it under $2,000 for right now.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I redeem Founder$hare mobile gift cards?</h3>\n\n<p>When you are in your favorite local store:<br />\n1. Go to foundershare.com from your smartphone and enter your username and password.<br />\n2. Click on the business of your choice and click redeem. You will be looking at a QR code (a black and white picture of a bunch of black squares in a pattern). Here&rsquo;s an example.<br />\n<img alt=\"qr\" src=\"https://foundershare.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/qr.png\" style=\"height:75px; width:75px\" /><br />\n3. Show your screen to the business employee so they can scan it.</p>\n\n<h3>I don&rsquo;t have a smartphone &ndash; should I buy a Founder$hare mobile gift card?</h3>\n\n<p>If you have friends that have smartphones, then yes! Founder$hare mobile gift cards make great gifts and you do not need a smartphone to gift them. If you do not plan to gift them and you do not own a smartphone, then it will be difficult for you to redeem them. We want the entire experience of buying and redeeming to be hassle free. We want you to say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; You need to have a smartphone for this type of experience.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I have to pay subscription fees?</h3>\n\n<p>There are no fees for Champions. We are just happy that you are supporting Main Street businesses!</p>\n\n<h3>How do I know that a business is legit?</h3>\n\n<p>Ideally, this should be a business you are already familiar with. Listen to the community &ndash; we will rely on our community to share positive comments as well as any concerns that you might have.</p>\n\n<h3>What if a business goes out of business?</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this is a reality of being in small business and why we founded FounderShare; to try to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen. However, there are no guarantees that this will not happen to a member of our community. If a Founder$hare mobile gift card has not been redeemed and the business goes bankrupt, then the gift card has no value.</p>\n\n<h3>What if a business owner will not redeem my Founder$hare?</h3>\n\n<p>That is not cool and we do not anticipate this happening. In the rare case that it does happen &hellip; On the menu to your phone, go &ldquo;Report Abuse&rdquo; and let us know about your experience right away. We will work with you and the business owner to try to rectify it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://foundershare.com/wp/?page_id=1174/#top\">BACK TO TOP</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>4.
